# healthcare-multiagent-symptom-checker
A web-based medical symptom checker based on multi-agent AI architecture. Patients enter their symptoms, and multiple agents (Analyzer, Condition Mapper, Advisor) interact to suggest possible conditions, severity, and self-care and treatment advice. LangChain manages agent interaction, with Flask handling the frontend.
