# Healthcare Multi-Agent Symptom Checker

A sophisticated web application that uses multiple AI agents to analyze symptoms and provide medical insights. Built with Python Flask backend and modern web technologies.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Many people experience symptoms but struggle to understand what they might indicate or when to seek medical help. Traditional symptom checkers often provide generic advice without considering the complexity of symptom interactions or the urgency of different conditions.

HealthCheck AI addresses this challenge by using a sophisticated multi-agent system that analyzes symptoms from multiple perspectives, providing more accurate and actionable health insights.

## ü§ñ Multi-Agent Workflow

Our system employs three specialized AI agents working in coordination:

### 1. Symptom Analyzer Agent
- **Purpose**: Parses and normalizes user input from free-text descriptions
- **Capabilities**:
  - Natural language processing of symptom descriptions
  - Symptom normalization and standardization
  - Severity detection from user language
  - Duration and onset pattern extraction
  - Confidence scoring for analysis quality

### 2. Condition Mapper Agent
- **Purpose**: Maps normalized symptoms to potential medical conditions
- **Capabilities**:
  - Rule-based condition matching using medical knowledge base
  - AI-enhanced analysis via Groq API (when available)
  - Confidence scoring and condition ranking
  - Fallback to rule-based analysis if API unavailable

### 3. Medical Advisor Agent
- **Purpose**: Provides medical advice and detects emergency situations
- **Capabilities**:
  - Emergency symptom detection and alerts
  - Treatment and medicine recommendations
  - Self-care guidance
  - "When to seek help" recommendations
  - Red flag identification for serious conditions
 
### 4. MultiAgentOrchestrator:
- **Purpose**: Coordinates the workflow between all agents to produce cohesive symptom analysis results.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Manages the interaction between AnalyzerAgent, ConditionMapperAgent, and AdvisorAgent
  - Ensures agents operate independently but collaborate for final output
  - Handles data passing and aggregation of results from all agents
  - Provides a single interface (process_symptoms) for the Flask app or API endpoints
  - Maintains agent status for debugging and health checks

## üß† LLM Selection: Groq API with Mixtral-8x7B

We selected Groq's Mixtral-8x7B model for several key reasons:

- **‚ö° Speed**: Ultra-fast inference for real-time symptom analysis
- **üéØ Accuracy**: Exceptional performance in medical text understanding
- **üí∞ Cost-Effective**: Efficient pricing model for educational applications
- **üîÑ Reliability**: Consistent performance with medical terminology
- **üõ°Ô∏è Fallback**: Graceful degradation to rule-based analysis when unavailable

## üìä Knowledge Base

Our comprehensive medical knowledge base includes:

- **22+ Medical Conditions** - From common colds to emergency conditions
- **150+ Symptoms** - Mapped and normalized symptom database
- **100+ Treatment Options** - OTC, prescription, and natural remedies
- **12 Emergency Indicators** - Critical symptoms requiring immediate attention

### Condition Categories:
- **Mild**: Common cold, tension headache, allergic rhinitis
- **Moderate**: Flu, migraine, UTI, bronchitis, anxiety, depression
- **Serious**: Hypertension, diabetes, asthma, pneumonia
- **Emergency**: Heart attack, stroke, appendicitis, severe allergic reactions

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd c_n_project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` file and add your Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   FLASK_ENV=development
   FLASK_DEBUG=True
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

### Getting a Groq API Key

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key to your `.env` file

**Note**: The application works without the Groq API key, falling back to rule-based analysis.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Web Interface

1. **Enter Symptoms**: Describe your symptoms in natural language
2. **Optional Information**: Add age and chronic conditions for better analysis
3. **Get Analysis**: Receive comprehensive symptom analysis
4. **Review Results**: 
   - Parsed and normalized symptoms
   - Potential medical conditions with confidence scores
   - Treatment recommendations
   - Emergency alerts (if applicable)
   - When to seek medical help
